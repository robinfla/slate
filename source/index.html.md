# Introduction

<a href="https://citizenplane.com/" target="_blank">CitizenPlane</a> is a software company that connects travel agencies and metasearches to air content providers. Our REST API allows ETAs to search within our stock of open flights, create bookings and process payments.

The default API endpoint is <a href="https://booking-api.citizenplane.com" target="_blank"> booking-api.citizenplane.com</a>. JSON is returned by all API responses, included errors.

To make the API as explorable as possible, accounts have test mode and live mode API tokens. Request made with test credentials will never hit the banking network and incur no cost. API tokens can be obtained after signup on <a href="https://citizenplane.com/" target="_blank">CitizenPlane</a>.

If you want to test the different endpoints detailed below, we have a dedicated page allowing you to perform request with your parameters. An API token will be required for each call. To test our endpoints, <a href-"https://booking-api.citizenplane.com/documentation" target="_blank">click here</a>.

If you have any questions, feel free to send us a message at tech@citizenplane.com

# Authentication


```shell
# Example request

curl "https://booking-api.citizenplane.com/airports/origins" \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer {your_api_token}"

# Make sure to replace {your_api_token} with the token you were given.
```

Authentication to the API is performed via Bearer Tokens. Once you have registered your account with us, you will be given a test token to ensure a proper integration period. When you"re ready to go live, we will assign you a live token. Make sure not to share your token in publicly accesible area such GitHub or client-side code.

Every request to CitizenPlane API must include a Bearer token in the following format: `Authorization: Bearer {your_api_token}`

This endpoint creates a booking request on a specific flight identified by its id. A booking request holds a number of seats passed in the request payload for fifteen minutes. Should the booking not be confirmed, the request would be canceled and the seats put back in sales. Seat price and infant price won't be subject to any changes during this time period and will match the information sent by the /flights request.

This endpoint confirms the previously created booking request and sends the booking information along with card information to CitizenPlane's API in order to process the booking and the associated payment. Once the booking is created, the customer will receive a confirmation by email along with the ticket(s). If the payment fails for any reason, the request associated to this booking will be considered as `ABORTED` and the process is to be started again.

# Testing

A test environment has been set up to ensure a proper integration. During this process, you will be given a **test token** allowing you to make calls in a controlled environment. Before going live, a **partner token** will be assigned to you. This token is **unique** and **non-expirable**.

## How testing works

If you'd like to test our endpoints, you can use tools like Postman or curl or you can use our additional API documentation which allows you to make calls directly, <a href-"https://booking-api.citizenplane.com/documentation" target="_blank">from this page</a>.

### Retrieve all departure airports

A simple **GET** request returning the list of all origin airports that are currently associated with open routes in CitizenPlane's stock. No specific instruction is needed for this request.

### Retrieve a list of arrival airports

A simple **GET** request returning the list of all our destination airports (given an `origin` iata code) that are currently associated with open routes in CitizenPlane's stock. No specific instruction is needed for this request.

### Retrieve a list of flights

Given the limited available data to be requested, here are some guidelines to get proper responses according to the following query parameters: 

- `origin` & `destination`

Please make sure to requests only flights with the following origin & destination airports : 

airport name | iata code | country
------------ | --------- | -------
Brussels | BRU | Belgium
Roissy Charles-De-Gaulle | CDG | France
Djerba-Zarzis | DJE | Tunisia
Antalya | AYT | Turkey
Heraklion | HER | Greece
Adnan Menderes | ADB | Turkey
Orly | ORY | France

Any combination of these airports as `destination` or `origin` airports will return a result. 

- `nearbyO` & `nearbyD`

If set to true, the result will include any flight combination of nearby origin airports (if `nearbyO === 'true'`) and nearby destination airports (if `nearbyD === 'false'`) up to 100km. 

To test this option, please use the two airports located in Paris: CDG & ORY. Other airports won't return any flights associated to nearby airports. 

- `seats`

Available flights hold between 5 and 70 seats. Make sure your `seats` parameter is always below 70. Note that infants (< 2 yo) don't take a seat.

 - `start` & `end`

 Available flights range from 2018-07-10 to 2018-09-13. Make sure your `start` and `end` parameters are between this date range.

### Create a request

 Creates a booking request that will hold the requested number of seats during a limited time period. If the request expires, the seats are no longer reserved and the process has to be started again. 

 Use any of the `flight_id` returned by the **/flights** call to create a request. To ensure that your request is accepted, note that: 

 - `effective_price` should equal `online_price` returned the the **/flights** call on the selected flight
 - `passengers` should not hold more than 70 adults and children (combined). Note that infants (< 2 yo) do not take a seat on the booking reservation.

 ### Create a booking

 Confirms the booking requests and creates a booking on the given flight. This call also processes the payment for the customer. 

 **Some instructions for the payload object:** 

 - `flight_id`: an id returned by the **/flights** call
 - `request_id`: an id returned by the **/requests** call
 - `effective_price` should equal `online_price`, returned by the **/flights** call on the selected flight
 - `passenger_count` and `infant_count` should match the `passengers` information
